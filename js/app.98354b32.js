The Middle Ages are a historical period that lasted for more than 1000 years. During this time, people wandered a lot, exploring new territories. This is how nomadic people were born. Also during this time, wars were faught everywhere in Europe. Kings and the territories they ruled, named 'kingdoms', also appeared during the Middle Ages.","text-1":"Timișoara was named 'Temesvar' back then and it was part of the kingdom of Hungary.","text-2":"The city as we know it today didn't exist yet. There were just some islands on which people built houses. There were only 20 houses and 200 inhabitants in the entire settlement. These islands were formed by the arms of the rivers Bega and Timiş. On the biggest island, a fortress of cob. That is, earth mixed with straws.","text-3":"In the Middle Ages, people lived without supermarkets and fast food. They ate fruits and vegetables from their own gardens and animals they raised in their back yard. It wasn't cool to wash and soap as we know it today didn't exist yet. They used plants to treat any disease and if the illness was more serious, they used leeches. Because Timişoara was built on islands surrounded by water, there were a lot of mosquitoes, and people were often getting sick from malaria.","text-4":"Around 1300 AD, a sort of strategy game was played between two noble men, Otto of Bavaria and Robert of Anjou.","text-5":"These two men had to prove their negociation skills and the one who managed to gain the most allies would become king of Hungary. Robert came to Timișoara to set a military base and to seek allies. He ordered the building of a bigger and stronger fortress than the one made out of cob. Robert of Anjou was very skilled in negociation, so he won the game. He then became king of Hungary and Timişoara became the capital city of the kingdom. Because of this, Timişoara became famous all over Europe, and a lot of people came to live here. The number of inhabitants grew and a lot of houses were built.","text-6":"After the city grew, Robert of Anjou moved to Buda – in the town that is now part of the city of Budapest.","text-7":"Almost 100 years after Robert of Anjou left, John Hunyadi arrived at Timişoara.","text-8":"John Hunyadi was like a prince from Transylvania, and because he had this title, he was also the ruler of Timișoara. He ordered that the old palace in the fortress is also reinforced. He was concerned with the town's safety, so he brought canons and built defensive walls.","text-9":"The fortress of Timișoara became stronger and stronger. The town around it was also growning and with it, more and more stories were born.","text-10":"An interesting story is the one of Pavel Cnezul, another important ruler of Timiș county.","text-11":"Pavel Cnezul was also known as Pavel the Chinese, but he had no connections with China. He joined the army as a simple soldier, and because he was brave and good with strategy he quickly became captain general and then count (the ruler of the entire territory around Timișoara during the rein of Matthias Corvinus). He was a skilled military leader that managed to defeat the Ottomans (the Turks) a number of times.","text-12":"The legend says he could lift 2 Turks at once and carry then under his arms (that's like lifting weights at the gym today). As long as Pavel was leading the army, the dangerous Turks didn't invade the fortress of Timișoara. But e will find out more about the Turks and how they conquered the fortress in another story."},Pt={text:Mt},St={intro:"Ottoman isn't the name of an exotic fish, but the name of a great empire, that was born from a sultan's dream. In his dream, the sultan saw a big tree, so big that its shadow was cast over the entire world. When he woke up from his dream, the sultan understood the tree represented his empire that would take over the world.","text-1":"The sultan was living far away, in Istambul, in a big palace with lots of rooms and beautiful gardens. Rulers from all over the empire were invited by the sultan to come visit him at the palace.","text-2":"Ottomans prayed to Allah in special places called 'mosques'. The mosques had a high tower called a 'minaret'. From this tower, a priest named 'muezzin' was calling the people to come and pray.","text-3":"Almost 100 years after the first sultan dreamt of the big tree, his descendant, Suleyman the Magnificent, decided to conquer Timişoara and make it part of the shadow of the big tree. After trying again and again, he succeeded.","text-4":"Timişoara was conquered by Ottomans in the summer of 1552.","text-5":"It is said that this was a very hot summer, so hot that the frogs from the marshes around the city started to look for cooler homes inside the still moist wells.","text-6":"From the Turkish camp, set on the entire field around the city walls, you could hear short orders. Ahmed Pasha, Suleyman the Magnificent's second in command, was commanding his soldiers to send to the 'ghiaurs' worthy of Hell (meaning 'Christian soldiers') arrows with messages demanding them to surrender.","text-7":"Inside the city walls, the soliders and the inhabitants already knew that the Christian legion of German, Spanish, Polish, Hungarian and Romanian soldiers could not last long against the Ottoman army with its 16 cannons, that was also attacking them from 6 sides.","text-8":"Therefore, on a hot night of July, Ştefan Lossonczy, the Timişoara troups commander, tired after one month of fighting, answered gave in to the request to surrender. Ahmed paşa had promised him that he will let him and his soliders live if they surrendered. In the morning mist, a long line of soldiers led by Lossonczy himself, faced Ahmed without swords, horses or armour. but the vizier didn't keep his word! The commander was beheaded and the survivors were massacred by the janissaries.","text-9":"The town of Timişoara with its rose gardens and the fertile river became part of the shadow of the dream tree. Was the town deserted during the Ottoman rule? Did eveybody run? Or were there only Turks in the city? No, not at all! After the shock of losing the fortress, life had to go on!","text-10":"Since that scotching night of July, for 164 years, the inhabitants had a new experience, with people that spoke a foreign language and were wearing turbans instead of heats, who brought with them the coffee, the rice, the mosque, the baklava but also new words, like hookah, rakia or sarma.","text-11":"The citadel, like a giant turtle with its feet in the marshes, was now ruled by a pasha. Some churches were turned into mosques, like Sf. George's curch. Four bigger mosques were built. The Ottomans also built public baths like they had back home, which were very similar to the spas we have today. They paved the roads with wooden boards, so that the wheels of the carts don't get stuck in the mud. Otherwise, even a whole elephant might have gotten stuck!","text-12":"During this time, Timişoara had 400 shops, but also cafes, because the Turks loved coffee and tobacco, although it's not healthy, but back then, this was not yet known!","text-13":"But the most crowded place was the market, also known as 'bazaar'. There, merchants from the East met the ones from the West: Italians, Viennese, Polish or Transylvanian; there, you could see exotic fruit, amazing clothes and red leather shoes, fur of animals with strange names, delicious foods and spices and porcelain toys.","text-14":"Unfortunately, the inhabitants of the 1500 houses of Timişoara were not ecologists, as they were dumping all their trash in the river.","text-15":"What did the people of Timişoara eat during this time?","text-16":"Honey cake and butter pie for good children, black soup, for bad children. You could also get cabbage or stuffed pumpkin. If you were poor, a small bread named 'ţipău' (from 'czipo' in Hungarian) and a piece of cheese. If you grew them in the garden, you could also eat cabbage, sweet peas or lentils. The most sought after meat was lamb, but also mouton and poultry, cooked in different ways and exotic dishes. Fish was also appreciated.","text-17":"In the summer time, from the gardens around the city, or bought from merchants, fruit were prized: sour cherries, strawberries, plums and pears. Everywhere you could find mead, a sweet drink made with honey, with a taste similar to cough syrup and a bit sparkling. Beer was also known and enjoyed by everybody. Spiced with ginger and armomatic plats, it doesn't taste like the ones grown-ups enjoy nowadays at the pub.","text-18":"We also took some recipes from ottoman cuisine: 'sarmale', 'pilaf' or minced meat meals and many recipes of pies with sweetened and flavored pie crusts and fruits sweetened with honey (sugar was not yet known).","text-19":"How did the people of Timişoara dress?","text-20":"Without shops for clothes or clothing factories, simple people worn canvas clothes. In wintertime, they added also wool clothes. Men had some sort of trousers held together with stiches. At the knee, these trousers had a piece of fine goat leather, like the knee pads we have today for riding the bike! The canvas shirt, a vest, and a clorful cap, also made out of canvas, were making the outfit complete. The also worn bulky shoes made out of cow leather.","text-21":"Women were wearing their hair pinned under a bonnet, at church, at the market but also at home. They were also putting an apron over their colorful canvas dresses, tied with a strap. Because they had no bags, they were hanging their money bag and their house keys from another strap. An permantent piece of clothing that they wore was also their shwal, from canvas or wool, wrapped around their shoulders.","text-22":"Children were dressed like smaller adults.","text-23":"A story written by Dr. Livia Magina"},Ht={text:St},Et={about:{"text-1":At.text["text-1"],"text-2":At.text["text-2"],"text-3":At.text["text-3"],financed:"This project was financed by"},errors:{error404:"Oops!
